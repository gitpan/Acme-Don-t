                   Release of version 1.01 of Acme::Don::t
==============================================================================


NAME
    Acme::Don't - The opposite of `do'

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Don't;

        don't { print "This won't be printed\n" };    # NO-OP

DESCRIPTION
    The Acme::Don't module provides a `don't' command, which is the opposite
    of Perl's built-in `do'.

    It is used exactly like the `do BLOCK' function except that, instead of
    executing the block it controls, it...well...doesn't.

    Regardless of the contents of the block, `don't' returns `undef'.
